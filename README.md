# Payments-Synthetic-Data
** Business Problem:** I am designing a foundational data competency course for my organization and I need robust, relatable data set that covers key areas of foundational stats and data science: 

This project aims to synthetically generate diverse datasets with specific statistical attributes for an introductory statistics course in data science. It involves creating 20 groups of data with varying means, standard deviations, and shapes, including a subset with added dates for time series analysis. The generated data should highlight aspects such as outliers, normal distribution, measures of central tendencies, non-normal distribution (bimodal), and time series, with a subsequent organization and consolidation into specific sections for enhanced risk analysis and payment processing times.
